       <p> 1. The Pretender
       <pre>
        Keep you in the dark
        You know they all pretend
        Keep you in the dark
        And so it all began
        Send in your skeletons
        Sing as their bones go marching in again
        They need you buried deep
        The secrets that you keep are ever ready
        Are you ready?
        I'm finished making sense
        Done pleading ignorance
        That whole defense
        Spinning infinity, boy
        The wheel is spinning me
        It's never-ending, never-ending
        Same old story
        What if I say I'm not like the others?
        What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
        You're the pretender
        What if I say I will never surrender?
        What if I say I'm not like the others?
        What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
        You're the pretender
        What if I say that I'll never surrender?
        In time or so I'm told
        I'm just another soul for sale, oh well
        The page is out of print
        We are not permanent
        We're temporary, temporary
        Same old story
        What if I say I'm not like the others?
        What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
        You're the pretender
        What if I say that I'll never surrender?
        What if I say I'm not like the others?
        What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
        You're the pretender
        What if I say I will never surrender?
        I'm the voice inside your head
        You refuse to hear
        I'm the face that you have to face
        Mirroring your stare
        I'm what's left, I'm what's right
        I'm the enemy
        I'm the hand that'll take you down
        Bring you to your knees
        So, who are you?
        Yeah, who are you?
        Yeah, who are you?
        Yeah, who are you?
        Keep you in the dark
        You know they all pretend
        What if I say I'm not like the others?
        What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
        You're the pretender

        You're the pretender
        What if I say that I'll never surrender?
        What if I say you're not like the others? (Keep you in the dark)

       <p> 2. Come Alive
       <pre>
        Seems like only yesterday
        Life belonged to runaways
        Nothin' here to see
        No looking back
        Every sound monotone
        Every color monochrome
        Light began to fade
        Into the black
        Such a simple animal
        Sterilized with alcohol
        I could hardly
        Feel me anymore
        Desperate and meaningless
        All filled up with emptiness
        Felt like everything
        Was said and done
        I lay there in the dark
        And I close my eyes
        You saved me the day
        You came alive
        Still, I tried to find my way
        Spinnin' hours into days
        Burnin' like a flame
        Behind my eyes
        Drown it out
        Drink it in
        Crown the king of sufferin'
        Prisoner, slave to the disguise
        Disappear the only thing
        Bittersweet surrenderin'
        Knew that it was time
        To say goodbye
        And I lay there in the dark
        And I close my eyes
        You saved me the day
        You came alive
        No reason left
        Me to survive
        You saved me
        The day you came alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        I lay there in the dark
        And I close my eyes
        You saved me the day
        You came alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Nothin' more to give
        I can finally live
        Come alive
        Your life into me
        I can finally breathe
        Come alive
        I lay me down in the dark (come alive, come alive, come alive)
        Open my eyes (come alive, come alive, come alive, come alive, come alive)
        You saved me (come alive, come alive, come alive, come alive)
        The day you came alive (come alive, come alive, come alive, come alive)
        (come alive, come alive)
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive
        Come alive

        <pre>
        The sun went down on another perfect day
        Busy countin' shadows on the wall
        The weeds are swallowing up the flower bed
        Roses in the whiskey jar
        Blood on the thorns
        Drink until the taste is gone
        Cracks in the floorboards are deep
        From dancin' to the sound of candles burnin' out
        Heavy from writin' your resignations
        Licking bitter envelopes
        Blood on your tongue
        Drink until the taste is gone
        Where is your Shangri-La now?
        Where is your Shangri-La now?
        Countin' down to zero hour
        There ain't no superheroes now
        There ain't no superheroes, they're underground
        Happy ever after
        Countin' down to zero hour
        There ain't no superheroes now
        There ain't no superheroes, they're underground

        <p>5. Best of You
        <pre>
            I've got another confession to make
            I'm your fool
            Everyone's got their chains to break
            Holding you
            Were you born to resist or be abused?
            Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
            The best of you?
            Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
            The best of you?
            Are you gone and on to someone new?
            I needed somewhere to hang my head
            Without your noose
            You gave me something that I didn't have
            But had no use
            I was too weak to give in
            Too strong to lose
            My heart is under arrest again
            But I break loose
            My head is giving me life or death
            But I can't choose
            I swear I'll never give in
            I refuse
            Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
            The best of you?
            Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
            The best of you?
            Has someone taken your faith?
            It's real, the pain you feel
            Your trust, you must confess
            Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
            The best of you?
            Oh
            Oh, ho-oh
            Oh, oh-oh
            Oh, oh-oh
            Oh
            Has someone taken your faith?
            It's real, the pain you feel
            The life, the love you'd die to heal
            The hope that starts the broken hearts
            Your trust, you must confess
            Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
            The best of you?
            Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
            The best of you?
            I've got another confession, my friend
            I'm no fool
            I'm getting tired of starting again
            Somewhere new
            Were you born to resist or be abused?
            I swear I'll never give in, I refuse
            Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
            The best of you?
            Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
            The best of you?
            Has someone taken your faith
            It's real, the pain you feel
            Your trust, you must confess
            Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
            The best of you?
            Oh
